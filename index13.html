        Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. The framework 
        emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, 
        and the principle of don't repeat yourself.[8] Python is used throughout, even for settings, files, 
        and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface 
        that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.
